## Model Selection

In this section we will test the different models using the same dataset.  We will use the same features and dependent variable to give a fair comparison.  

We will use the `churn` dataset.  IMPORTANT: note that only 15% of the customers churn, which will be important for later.


```{r}
library(C50)
library(caret)
data(churn)

table(churnTest$churn)/nrow(churnTrain)
```

Earlier when we would create a train control object, we specified the method as "cv" and the number of folds.  Now we will use the same folds to re-use over hte multiple model training rounds.  We split the data using the `createFolds` functions, which creates a list (here a length of 5) containing the element indices for ech fold.

```{r}
data(churn)
churnTrain <- churnTrain
myFolds <- createFolds(churnTrain$churn, k = 5)
str(myFolds)
```

We want to verify that the folds maintain the proportion of yes/no results

```{r}
sapply(myFolds, function(i) {
    table(churnTrain$churn[i])/length(i)
})
```

Now that we have verified the folds are approximately proportional, we can create a train control object to be reused consistently for different model trainings.

```{r}
controlComparison <- trainControl(
  summaryFunction = twoClassSummary,
  classProbs = TRUE,
  verboseIter = TRUE,
  savePredictions = TRUE,
  index = myFolds
)
```


### `glmnet` model

```{r}
glm_model <- train(churn ~ .,
                   churnTrain,
                   metric = "ROC",
                   method = "glmnet",
                   tuneGrid = expand.grid(
                     alpha = 0:1,
                     lambda = 0:10/10),
                   trControl = controlComparison)

print(glm_model)
```

```{r}
plot(glm_model)
```


Below we will repeat this process with a variety of models.  using something like `caret` allows us to really test the different models to see which ones really do provide the best fit.

### Random Forest Model

```{r}
rf_model <- train(churn ~ .,
                  churnTrain,
                  metric = "ROC", 
                  method = "ranger",
                  trControl = controlComparison)
print(rf_model)
```

```{r}
plot(rf_model)
```

### Apply kNN model

```{r}
knn_model <- train(churn ~ .,
                  churnTrain,
                  metric = "ROC", 
                  method = "knn",
                  tuneLength = 20,
                  trControl = controlComparison)
print(knn_model)
```

```{r}
plot(knn_model)
```

### Support Vector Machine Model

```{r}
# getting the different possible models in caret
names(getModelInfo())

svm_model <- train(churn ~ .,
                  churnTrain,
                  metric = "ROC", 
                  method = "svmRadial",
                  tuneLength = 10,
                  trControl = controlComparison)
print(svm_model)
```

```{r}
plot(svm_model)
```


### Naive Bayes

```{r}
nb_model <- train(churn ~.,
                  churnTrain,
                  metric = "ROC",
                  method = "naive_bayes",
                  trControl = controlComparison)

print(nb_model)
```


```{r}
plot(nb_model)
```
